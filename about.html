                <div class="txt">
                    <p>Darlene was born on November 5, 1990. She states she was 4 years old when she first saw Susan Jacobs when E Corp was vindicated in the Washington Township trial. Her father, Edward Alderson, died on February 28, 1995. Her mother, Magda, was abusive toward her and her brother.</p>
                    <p>When she was 5, she was kidnapped by a woman during a family trip to an amusement park. She slept at the woman's house, in a pink bedroom, and awoke the next morning to the police. Darlene recalls the experience somewhat fondly. However, in contrast to her story, her father was dead by the time she turned five on November 5, 1995.</p>
                    <p>According to Elliott, Darlene once took a kitten home unbeknown to her mother. She named it Moonpie after her favorite food and kept it in her room for a while. Eventually she built a secret house for it in her backyard where it was discovered by her mother. She drove Darlene, Moonpie and Elliott to a nearby lake with the intention of making Darlene drown the cat. Darlene ran off with the cat and was missing for at least three days. When she returned, she explained that she had given it to an old lady three blocks away and that she felt like she had won.</p>
                    <p>She and Elliot would sleep in the same bed when their mother was mean to them and spend the whole day in movie theaters. They both developed a love for an obscure horror movie The Careful Massacre of the Bourgeoisie. Every Halloween they would watch it, joined by their friend Angela Moss, whose mother died in the Washington Township scandal. Darlene would often ride her scooter outside their house.</p>
                    <p>On Halloween night 2014, she makes a surprise visit to her brother's apartment, returning to NYC. While watching their favorite movie, Elliot is inspired to form fsociety. By Thanksgiving, she is working with Mobley and Trenton. During this time, she is dating Cisco and living with him. She breaks up with him when he asks her to marry him.</p>

                    <p>Elliot suffers from social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, delusions and paranoia. His internal life is revealed via voice-overs that provide insight into his mental state, his opinions of the people he encounters and the activity around him. These dialogues with the audience are designed to help us interpret Elliot's world, but given his mental illness, he is an unreliable narrator, leaving us unsure whether what he tells us we're seeing is actually what is happening. Typical of this is when Elliot hears everyone around him refer to E Corp as Evil Corp, reflecting his own opinion of the conglomerate.</p>
                    <p>Elliot is an introverted, socially awkward person who holds in a lot of anger, mainly towards the society that he is unable to participate in. He suffers from anxiety, which makes it difficult for him to participate in social situations. Because of this anxiety, he is unable to bring himself to attend Angela's birthday party, much to her frustration. Despite this, he will at times try to overcome his fear. Elliot is rarely seen not wearing a black hoodie which may be his personal uniform for the world and a comfort blanket of sorts. It also allows him to blend in to the world, much like a featureless, black anonymous avatar.</p>
                    <p>Before Elliot worked as an engineer at Allsafe Cybersecurity, he previously worked as a white-hat hacker for a cyber company, looking for holes in the system until it was "hacker-proof". On Memorial Day weekend when everybody else wanted to leave to party, Elliot continued to hack the company and they couldn't lock down the servers. They locked Elliot in the server room for the night. When Elliot woke up after falling asleep after a few hours, he found all the servers in the room had been destroyed, but he had no memory of it, suggesting this was a 'black out' where another personality had taken over. He was subsequently taken to court and the judge made him go to therapy with Krista Gordon for anger management. It was childhood friend Angela Moss who encouraged him to take the job at Allsafe.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Robot is the co-founder and leader of the hacker group fsociety, a revolutionary prophet who plans to bring down the world's largest conglomerate. Though he is intelligent and charismatic, Mr. Robot is also emotionally manipulative, and can be quick to turn violent.</p>
                    <p>It eventually becomes clear that Mr. Robot is a construct within Elliot Alderson's mind. (“eps1.8_m1rr0r1ng.qt”) His persona is an idealized representation of Elliot's deceased father, Edward; where Edward was unwilling or unable to take action, Mr. Robot was created to inspire war against E Corp and incite historical change. In some situations, Mr. Robot will take control and act through Elliot, thus explaining his direct interactions with other people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robot approaches Elliot on the subway. He wins Elliot over by telling a story about his father, a career criminal who believed that theft was simply part of the way the world worked. As long as he stole without being caught, he was fulfilling his contract with society. Initially impressed by this ethos, Mr. Robot lost faith when his father was jailed, eventually realizing that he and everyone else were prisoners of capitalism.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robot leads Elliot to a run-down property in Coney Island. He explains that the Fun Society arcade is the base of operations for a major project, and that participants meet face-to-face to avoid the inherent flaws in digital security.</p>
                    <p>n their next meeting, Mr. Robot explains fsociety's agenda: they intend take down E Corp by destroying their financial data, erasing consumer debt and devastating the capitalist economy. He asks Elliot to take the first step towards global revolution by altering the .dat file recovered from server CS30, replacing fsociety's IP address with that of E Corp CTO Terry Colby. Though Elliot has misgivings, he follows through on the plan, and Terry Colby is arrested.</p>

                    <p>Tyrell Wellick was born in Västra Götalands län, Sweden. His father knew very little English, but took great pride in his ability to recite a poem by William Carlos Williams: "So much depends on a red wheelbarrow glazed with rainwater beside the white chickens." Later in life, he would come to hate his father and fear becoming him.</p>
                    <p>As a child, he became proficient at chopping wood, but stopped because he hated it.</p>
                    <p>Tyrell began his career at E Corp as a highly knowledgeable technician, rising up the ranks of the conglomerate and eventually gaining the position of Senior Vice President of Technology. He served as the ambitious right-hand man of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Terry Colby.</p>
                    <p>Tyrell is married to a Danish woman, Joanna Olafson. To all appearances, they are a perfect couple; between themselves, they speak their respective languages, planning how to climb the corporate ladder.</p>
                    <p>During their first date, Tyrell promised that he would do anything to please her; Joanna told him to sleep with a red-haired woman, and steal her cheap earrings. He obliged without hesitation, and has provided Joanna with small, unusual gifts ever since.</p>

                    <p>Whiterose is the leader of the Dark Army, a Chinese hacker group. She is a transgender woman masquerading as the male Zhi Zhang, the Chinese Minister of State Security. She's also the founder and leader of the Deus Group. She is played by BD Wong.</p>
                    <p>Whiterose is shrouded in mystery. By the mid-90s, she has risen to her position of power within the Dark Army and has set up a relationship with E Corp. In 1995, she had the E Corp CEO killed in a plane crash over matters concerning her interest in the Washington Township power plant. Her group recruited Francis Shaw, a white 10 year old outcast living in Shanghai in 1996.</p>
                    <p>The Dark Army has garnered the reputation of having no code, hacking for anyone including Russia, North Korea, Iran; giving the impression that they hate U.S. capitalism. It is said that many Dark Army haven't even met Whiterose and believe their leader to be a man.</p>
                    <p>Records indicate that Zhang does not have a sister. She also wear a watch that beeps whenever a minute has passed due to her obsession with managing time. She has an extremely rigid schedule, rarely seeing anyone twice.</p>
                    <p>Whiterose has a personal project situated at the Washingtown Township power plant. Both Emily Moss and Edward Alderson unknowingly contributed to the project during their employment at E Corp, and it was the raditation from the power plant which contributed to their deaths. The details of her project are unknown, however she has a strong interest in the plant and is willing to go to great lengths to protect it.</p>

                    <p>Angela was born on February 27, 1988, in New Jersey to Phillip Price and Emily Moss, but Emily refused to be with Phillip, instead choosing to marry Donald Moss, who became her adopted father. She is an only child. Her mother died as a result of the Washington Township leak of 1993. In the aftermath, she became friends with Darlene and Elliot Alderson, with whom she shared a love for the book From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Angela fondly remembers wanting to be like Claudia Kincaid, the story's adventurous heroine. She also remembers the Aldersons subjecting her to their favorite movie, The Careful Massacre of the Bourgeoisie, every Halloween.</p>
                    <p>Angela attended college, for which she is thousands of dollars in debt. She was employed by Allsafe Cybersecurity as an account executive in charge of E Corp's security contract. In late 2014, she recommended Elliot to her boss Gideon Goddard.</p>
                    <p>She has stated that she occasionally smokes weed with Elliot. At the start of 2015, she lives with her boyfriend Ollie Parker in New York City. She personally has a MacBook and uses OS X. She is an avid jogger.</p>
                    <p>Angela has a birthday party at a bar in February. She is disappointed when Elliot doesn't show up. When fsociety attacks E Corp's servers, she calls Elliot in the middle of the night to help Lloyd Chung, the engineer on call. The day after, Angela offers to smoke weed and watch Elliot's favorite movie, Back to the Future, but is surprised by the sight of a naked woman, Shayla, in his bed. She is supportive of the relationship and leaves.</p>

                    <p>Joanna had a daughter when she was 15 years old. The child was adopted by a couple. Joanna fondly recalls her first date with Tyrell, where he promised to do anything for her and delivered. She became pregnant in mid-2014 and likely married her husband sometime before. He speaks to her in Swedish while she speaks to him in Danish, the languages being similar enough to understand one another.</p>
                    <p>Joanna is seen urging Tyrell to tie her up during sex while she is very pregnant in March of 2015. She appears to want Tyrell to become CTO of E Corp just as much as he does, and is thus okay with Tyrell sleeping with other people to achieve the position, including the CEO's male secretary.</p>
                    <p>When her husband loses the position to Scott Knowles, she shows calm while Tyrell lashes out. She joins him for dinner with Scott and his wife Sharon. Joanna makes pleasant conversation with them, although she sneaks a glass of wine when no one is looking. Meanwhile, she encourages Tyrell to sexually pursue Sharon Knowles for leverage.</p>
                    <p>In a deleted scene, the Wellicks have an ultrasound done on their baby. The doctor suggests an induced labor, but Joanna refuses on the grounds that everything in their lives is planned and she wants her baby to come naturally.</p>
                    <p>The day after, Tyrell comes home early from work as Joanna scrubs a stain in a dress in the kitchen sink. She asks if he is moving forward on blackmailing Sharon Knowles with pictures he took of her during their tryst. A scandal would put Tyrell over Knowles in line for CTO. However, Tyrell suggests finding another way. Joanna urges him to not unravel what they have made. Later that day, her husband comes home and starts chugging liquor. He indirectly tells her of Elliot, realizes that they have been focused on the wrong players rather than God. She is confused. The police arrive at their home shortly after. Joanna is shocked at the news of Sharon Knowles's murder. Excusing herself to the kitchen, she induces labor with a fork, distracting the detectives and giving Tyrell time as she is rushed to a hospital.</p>

                    <p>Shayla Nico moved in to next to Elliot's apartment at 207 East Broadway, NYC sometime in 2014. She met him after she dropped a fish in a glass bowl given to her by her 6 year old niece in the hallway. Shayla saves the fish and asks Elliot to help her move a dresser in her apartment.</p>
                    <p>They later smoke weed outside. They get to know each other, in so much that Shayla deals drugs and Elliot doesn't like most people. She accepts the challenge to be the one, special person he does like. As she realizes she's late for a drink with her girl friends, Shayla offers to contact a supposed psychopath who can get Elliot his suboxone he requests with his morphine, claiming Elliot might be worth dealing with a psychopath. She leaves, giving him the fish, Qwerty.</p>
                    <p>Elliot recalls a memory when Shayla brought him to Coney Island. While riding the ferris wheel, she notices he is agitated. She explains that she saw a family photo at Coney Island on his book shelf and she thought it'd be nice.

                    <p>After the ferris wheel, they walk on the boardwalk and have a good time. Back at his apartment, they smoke weed laying on his bed. She says she likes staring at his face and asks to not be forgotten when Elliot's memory becomes corrupted.</p>
                    <p>Shayla takes promises seriously, likes humming songs she makes up, and often smokes weed and takes ecstasy to forget her problems.</p>

                    <p>Dominique was raised in Teaneck, New Jersey. Her parents bought a seemingly rare clock from the local Kmart, keeping it in the family room. Her mom Trudie lives in Philadelphia. She has an uncle Chris in Dallas. She has a kid brother, Joseph, for whom she rolled joints in high school. Joseph lives in Morrisville, PA and has a 4 year old son Jaime. Her older brother is named Jerry.</p>
                    <p>Mere days before graduating from law school, Dom received a marriage proposal from the person she was dating. She excused herself to the restroom, left out the back of the restaurant, and changed careers, joining the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
                    <p>On June 17, Dom is reading about the murder of Gideon at 4 in the morning while watching reality TV in bed. She gets ready for work, fixing her hair and makeup while drinking coffee, and stares blankly into the mirror. She reports to a murder scene where the NYPD found DiPierro's name among a list of FBI contacts printed out by deceased computer criminal Leslie Romero. Unimpressed by the NYPD's amateurish investigation, Dom takes a picture of the list and leaves them with her card.</p>
                    <p>On the night of June 21, she is masturbating on a cybersex chat room, but can't seem to find pleasure. (Trivia: her cyber sex partner's screen name is based on the character 'Happy Harry Hard-on' from the 1990 Christian Slater move 'Pump Up The Volume'. She asks Alexa when the end of the world is. Dom retrieves her phone from her safe and looks over the FBI names. The next day she returns to interview the Romero's eldery mother, winning her favor by rolling joints. DiPierro discovers a flyer for an "End of the World Party", and follows it to the Fun Society arcade in Coney Island.</p>
                    <p>Forensics specialists search the premises, finding a single spent bullet casing.The team are tracking down people who attended the party from the social media evidence and looking into the name "DJ Mobley." DiPierro's report on the arcade is submitted into evidence, where it is shared in the joint investigation with the Chinese Ministry for State Security.</p>

                    <p>Terence "Terry" Colby is a career executive, formerly Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of E Corp. Despite his position, Colby is not very up-to-date with technology; to compensate, he worked closely with the ambitious Senior Vice President of Technology, Tyrell Wellick.</p>
                    <p>In his capacity as CTO, Terry Colby and his entourage visit Allsafe Cybersecurity to coordinate their cyber defense.</p>
                    <p>Following fsociety's DDoS attack, representatives of E Corp, Allsafe, the FBI, and the United States Cyber Command were called together for a debriefing. Initially commending Elliot Alderson on countering the attack, Colby becomes impatient with Angela Moss, ridiculing her for small mistakes in her presentation and having her removed from the E Corp account. This does not sit well with Elliot, who submits false evidence implicating Terry Colby in fsociety's attack.</p>
                    <p>Weeks later, Colby is arrested for his alleged involvement, which the FBI suspects was intended to pressure E Corp during contract negotiations. (“eps1.0_hellofriend.mov”) fsociety focuses further attention on Colby by naming him as their leader and demanding his release.</p>
                    <p>Conducting a series of data dumps, fsociety reveals that Colby was one of three executives responsible for the Washington Township toxic waste scandal. Colby was aware of dangerous levels of toxicity at the plant, but declared that retooling the program would not be "cost-effective". This disclosure shocks both Elliot and Angela, whose parents died as a result of Colby's negligence.</p>
                    <p>Angela Moss combs the data dumps for actionable information and brings an annotated report to Antara Nayar, a lawyer who represented the plaintiffs in the original Washington Township class action. Though convinced of E Corp's guilt, Nayar is pessimistic about their chances against the largest conglomerate in history; she says that the only possible way to win is by finding an eyewitness willing to testify.</p>
